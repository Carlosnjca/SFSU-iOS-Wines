Estimated times:
Since everything is a learning curve for me, I am estimating no less than 70 hours for this project
  Must have features at least 50 hours
  Nice to have features at least 20 hours
  
NOTE:
This proposal is subject to change as the developing face begins

Why this idea:
   I like taking friends to the wineries when they visit me from out of state.  I usually have to be using the browser to do individual searches.  This app would make it easier to wine lovers to have access to this information from the main page of the app.  Additional features or search results could be display in secondary pages.
